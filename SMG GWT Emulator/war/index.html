    <h2>GWT Development Support</h2>
    If you developed a game for this course using GWT, you can use this emulator after making
    minimal changes in your game.<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Integrate the latest version of GameApi class in your project.<br>
    <li>Include the following line in your GWT xml file:<br>
    <code>&lt;inherits name='com.google.gwt.json.JSON'/&gt;</code></li>
    <li>In your EntryPoint class, use GameApi.ContainerConnector instead of IteratingPlayerContainer</li>
    <li>You only need to call ContainerConnector.gameReady() method initially, and the rest will be handled by the emulator</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Offline Usage Instructions</h2>
    For using this emulator with your game, you need to download the emulator to your 
    machine, and use it locally.<br>
    After downloading and unpacking the archive, run the "GwtEmulator.html" file in the 
    browser of your preference.<br>
    Provide the location of your game in the game URL textbox, provide other configuration
    details, and click on the "Start Game" button.<p>
    <i>Note:</i> You can host the emulator and your game on a server as well.<p>
    The easiest way to host files on your machine if you have Python is to 
    go to the required directory and run:<br>
    <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer &lt;port&gt;</code>
