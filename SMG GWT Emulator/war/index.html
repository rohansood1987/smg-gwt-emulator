    <h2>Offline Usage Instructions</h2>
    For using this emulator with your game, you need to download the emulator to your 
    machine, and use it locally.<br>
    After downloading and unpacking the archive, run the "GwtEmulator.html" file in the 
    browser of your preference.<br>
    Provide the location of your game in the game URL textbox, provide other configuration
    details, and click on the "Start Game" button.<p>
    <i>Note:</i> You can host the emulator and your game on a server as well, but please
    ensure that both the emulator and the game are either running locally, or hosted on
    the same server.<p>
    A simple way to host files on your machine if you have Python is to 
    go to the required directory and run:<br>
    <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer &lt;port&gt;</code>
