Server Tests:
We have written the server tests using the Jasmine testing framework. The specifications which are not finalized yet have been assumed by us for now, and when they are finalized, weâ€™ll be updating the tests accordingly.

You can find the the tests in GitHub folder "jasmine_server_tests".
They have also been deployed on Google App Engine at the following link: http://smg-gwt-emu-server-tests.appspot.com/
